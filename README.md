# Design, Analysis and Comparison of Biomimetic Hierarchical Honeycomb Sandwich Composites for Aerospace Applications
- This project is my Master Thesis Topic and I carried out my thesis at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.
  
- This study explores a **novel biomimetic honeycomb structure** inspired by natural hexagonal patterns found in honeycombs and spider webs. Adopting these biomimetic principles, with the aid of primarily **SOLIDWORKS** and **ANSYS SpaceClaim 2024**, a conventional honeycomb core is designed, and three hierarchical honeycomb variants namely first order, second order and the third order are designed. The panels were assembled between face sheets for a sandwich composite specimen. Each variant incorporates hierarchical hexagonal infill patterns interconnected by web-like frameworks resembling **spider cobwebs**.

The composite structure consists of:

- Face Sheets: **Carbon Fibre-Polyether Ether Ketone (CF-PEEK)**
- Core: **Aluminium 7075 T6**

Mechanical performance is evaluated through a **static three-point bending test** using ANSYS 2024 R1 to analyze flexural behavior, focusing on parameters like stiffness and weighted stiffness. Results of each hierarchical honeycomb panel are compared to conventional honeycomb designs and the data is tabulated for comparison.

The findings highlight the effectiveness of biomimetic design principles in optimizing material performance for aerospace applications, where weight efficiency and structural integrity are paramount. By emulating natural geometries, this research paves the way for the development of innovative, high-performance materials that achieve a balance between strength, weight, and durability.

## Project Overview  
In the world of aerospace engineering, composite materials play a huge role and create a vast impact because of their highly favourable mechanical properties and their versatility. When mechanical properties are considered in choosing a material for aerospace applications, be it the outer skin of the launch vehicles, fuselage, re-entry capsules, space-crafts and satellites, Stiffness is the highly considered property. Also, for aerospace, strength to weight ratio plays a major role in material selection. This made me think about creating a new design or making an innovation in the aerospace materials. We all know that spider webs have the best tensility and strength-weight ratio. This drove me to delve deeper into the mechanics of spider webs, and that's when I found, the radial patterns of the spider cobwebs are the main reason for their efficient energy distribution and higher stiffness of the webs, because of their remarkable fibonacci sequential pattern. Also one of the well developed designs in the composite materials industry, is the Honeycomb panel design for their structural efficiency and material effectiveness. This made me think aboyt merging these two nature's designs to create my hierarchical honeycomb cores inspired from the spider web patterns, which I have tried my best to mimic the patterns.

## Key Results  
- Overall higher Strength - weight ratio was achieved in the hierarchical honeycomb panels when compared with the conventional honeycomb panel 
- There was a significant increase in the specific stiffness of the third order hierarchical honeycomb panel around 65% when compared with the conventional honeycomb panel.
